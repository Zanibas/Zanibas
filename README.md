### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My interests are exploring the intersection between mental health and technology, specifically:
- How mental health services can be enhanced with technology
- How technology, especially social media and online news, shapes our mental health
- How games and visualizations can be used to illustrate and spark discussions on various mental health topics.

I am currently practicing D3.js, trying out Next.js, and brushing up on SQL. I have recently started coding again after a recent layoff, so please excuse some of my dust.

I just now realized that the /USERNAME repository is for the profile README.md. Please ignore that I just tried rewriting my GitHub page here instead of on /USERNAME.github.io

Have a nice day!
